Starboard Isn't Working

Try mentioning the bot, and if that doesn't work let us know.

Starboard isn't sending messages to the starboard
There can be multiple reasons for this, please check the following:
 - self-starring (starring your own messages) doesn't work if the setting is disabled
 - if botsOnStarboard is False, bot messages can't be starred
 - check to make sure requiredStars is what you think it is
You can see settings for a specific starboard by running `[p]settings <starboard>`, and you can change them by running `[p]<setting> <starboard> <value>`.
